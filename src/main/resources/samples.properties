examples.chapters.code.heading            = Code
examples.chapters.codeblocks.heading      = Code Blocks
examples.chapters.codeblocks.intro        = Code blocks are not easy to visualize in this README.md file, as each example is already printed in three different code blocks (see each example of `Java Code`, `Markdown` and `Rendered`)
examples.chapters.customRenderer.heading  = Custom Renderer
examples.chapters.emphasis.heading        = Emphasis
examples.chapters.escaping.heading        = Escaping

examples.chapters.paragraphs.heading      = Paragraphs and Line Breaks
examples.chapters.paragraphs.intro        = The two most important elements when working with Markdown Builder are block elements and span elements. Block elements are separated from each other by a blank line and render as a paragraph.

examples.chapters.unorderedLists.heading  = Unordered Lists
examples.chapters.unorderedLists.intro    = The first block element appended to a list item must always be a paragraph. Meaning text only. But further block elements can be added and they can be of any type. They will align nicely with the list items indent.
